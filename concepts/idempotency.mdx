The in case where an operation can potentially mutate resources within a system, an idempotency key is required.
The key is used to assure that, no matter how many times the operation is applied, the mutation only takes place at most once.

## Representation in a Request

Idempotency keys are universally unique identifiers and should be passed into the header as `X-Idempotency-Key`.

```bash
  curl --request POST \
    --url http://api.pipevest.com/v1/auth \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    --header 'Signature: ...' \
    --header 'Signature-Input: ...' \
    --header 'X-Idempotency-Key: b9fa7097-befa-4869-a91b-a7f79400d917' \
    --data 'clientId=<client-id>'
    --data 'clientSecret=<client-secret>'
```
