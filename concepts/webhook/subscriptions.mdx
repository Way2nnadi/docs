Subscriptions represent the various events that can be triggered within the system.
They are broken down into:

- `Top-level`
- `Low-level`

## Top Level Subscriptions

`ALL` is the highest top level subscription and subscribes your webhook to all events triggered within the system.

| Subscription | Definition                                                                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ALL`        | Subscribes to all other high level subscribtions defined within the system |

These other top level subscriptions, will subscribe to all events within its domain.

| Subscription      | Definition                                | Domain          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `ACCOUNT`         | Only events that deal with accounts       | Accounts        |
| `ASSET`           | Only events that deal with assets         | Assets          |
| `AUTH`            | Only events that deal with authentication | Authentications |
| `CUSTOMER`        | Only events that deal with customers      | Customers       |
| `INSTRUMENT`      | Only events that deal with instruments    | Instruments     |
| `INVESTMENT_TYPE` | Only events that deal with investments    | Investments     |
| `PORTFOLIO`       | Only events that deal with portfolios     | Portfolios      |
| `REQUEST`         | Only events that deal with requests       | Requests        |
| `REPORT`          | Only events that deal with reports        | Reports         |
| `TRANSACTION`     | Only events that deal with transactions   | Transactions    |
| `WEBHOOK`         | Only events that deal with webhooks       | Webhooks        |

<Note>
  For example if you subcribed to `ACCOUNT`, it means that subscriptions to both
  `ACCOUNT.CREATED` and `ACCOUNT.UPDATED` will be subcribed.

## Low Level Subscriptions

These are more granular subscriptions that limits the event scope of your webhook configuration.

| Subscription              | Definition                                                              | Domain          |

## Combining Subscriptions

The flexible nature of this subscripton model means that they can be mixed and combined at your discretion.
This is especially important when using the `ALL` subscription.

| Combos                 | Definition                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High Level + Low Level | Subscribe to all the events within the high level domain but only that low level event within its domain |
| `ALL` + Low level      | Subscribe to all events in the system but only that low level event with its domain                      |
| `ALL` + High level     | Sames as just subscribing to `ALL`                                                                       |
| High Level             | Only subscribe to all the events within the high level domain                                            |
| Low Level              | Only Subscribe just that low level event with its domain                                                 |

## Default Subscription

Upon creating a webhook, an automatic subscription to `WEBHOOK.CREATED` is made.
This will serves as an initial test of your webhook connection.

The payload should look similar to this:

```json
{
  "eventId": "38f429d1-2dda-4429-91e7-88696716c050",
  "event": "WEBHOOK.CREATED",
  "createdAt": 1732893584,
  "data": {
    "webhookId": 123456,
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "url": "https://companyx.com/webhooks",
    "subscriptions": [
      ...,
      "WEBHOOK.CREATED"
    ],
    "createdAt": 1732893594,
    "updatedAt": 1732893594
  }
}
```

## Updating Subsubscriptons

Subscriptions can be update be making a `PUT` request to [/webhooks](/api-reference/endpoint/webhooks/update)

```bash
  curl --request PUT \
    --url https://api.pipevest.com/v1/webhooks \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer 123456' \
    --header 'Content-Digest: sha-512=:RK/0qy18MlBSVnWgjwz6lZEWjP/lF5HF9bvEF8FabDg=:' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/application/json' \
    --header 'Signature: sig1=:OTEyMjY4...A5NTNDMEQ=:' \
    --header 'Signature-Input: sig1=("Content-Type" "Content-Digest" "Content-Length" "Authorization" "X-Client-Id" "X-Idempotency-Key" "@method" "@target-uri" "@path" "@query");keyid="staging-pipevest-ed25519";created=1732893484;expires=1732893584' \
    --header 'X-Client-Id: 123456' \
    --header 'X-Idempotency-Key: 123456' \
    ...
    --data '{"subscriptions": ["ALL"]}'
```

<Warning>
  Updaing the list of `subscriptions` will replace the previous subscriptions.
