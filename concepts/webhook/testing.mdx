title: "Testing Webhook"
---

To test your webhook, simply make a request to [/webhook/test](/api-reference/endpoint/webhooks/createTest).
This will trigger a test payload to be sent to the webhook url.

Payload should look similar to this:

```json
{
  "eventId": "6c707869-5b99-4208-b074-9f407da672b9",
  "event": "WEBHOOK.TEST",
  "createdAt": 1732893584,
  "data": null
}
```
