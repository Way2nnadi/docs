[Investment Types](#investment-types) represent the bucket of different financial products that are available for trade on the Pipevest platform.
This document will guide you on how to **get** investment type details.

## Retrieving Investment Types

When requesting investment types details you can do so either by getting:

- A list of investment types
- An investment type by a given Id

#### List of Investment Types

<Tip>
  Make a `GET` request to
  [/investments](/api-reference/endpoint/investments/get).
</Tip>

```bash
  curl --request GET \
    --url https://api.pipevest.com/v1/investments\
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer 123456' \
    --header 'Signature: sig1=:OTEyMjY4...A5NTNDMEQ=:' \
    --header 'Signature-Input: sig1=("Authorization" "Content-Digest" "Content-Length" "Content-Type" "X-Client-Id" "X-Idempotency-Key" "@method" "@target-uri" "@path" "@query");keyid="staging-pipevest-ed25519";created=1732893484;expires=1732893584' \
    --header 'X-Client-Id: 123456' \
```

<Note>This endpoint can be [paginated and sorted](/concepts/pagination).</Note>
